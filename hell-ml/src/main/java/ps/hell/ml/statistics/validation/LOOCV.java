 * 分析交叉验证。LOOCV涉及使用单一的观察

*观察训练数据。这是重复的,这样每一个
*观察在示例使用一次的验证数据。这是
*一样K-fold交叉验证与K等于的数量
*观察原样品。分析交叉验证是
*通常从计算的观点来看,因为非常昂贵的
*大的重复次数的训练过程
 * Leave-one-out cross validation. LOOCV involves using a single observation
 * from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining
 * observations as the training data. This is repeated such that each
 * observation in the sample is used once as the validation data. This is
 * the same as a K-fold cross-validation with K being equal to the number of
 * observations in the original sample. Leave-one-out cross-validation is
 * usually very expensive from a computational point of view because of the
 * large number of times the training process is repeated.
